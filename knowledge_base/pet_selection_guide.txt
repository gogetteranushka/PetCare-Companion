# Pet Selection Guide

## Lifestyle Compatibility Factors

### Space Requirements
- Dogs: Varies by breed; small dogs (20-40 sq ft), medium dogs (40-80 sq ft), large dogs (80+ sq ft plus outdoor access)
- Cats: Minimum 18 sq ft of accessible space with vertical options
- Small mammals: Cage requirements - Guinea pigs (7.5 sq ft), Hamsters (24x12 inches), Rabbits (4x2 ft minimum)
- Birds: Cage size varies by species - Parakeets (18x18x18 inches), Cockatiels (20x20x24 inches)
- Reptiles: Bearded dragons (40+ gallon terrarium), Leopard geckos (20 gallon terrarium)
- Fish: Tank size depends on species and number - Betta (5+ gallons), Community tank (20+ gallons)

### Time Commitment
- Dogs: High (3-4 hours daily) - walks, training, play, feeding, grooming
- Cats: Medium (1-2 hours daily) - play, feeding, litter box maintenance
- Small mammals: Medium (1-2 hours daily) - cage cleaning, handling, feeding
- Birds: Medium-high (2-3 hours daily) - social interaction, cage cleaning, feeding
- Reptiles: Low-medium (30-60 minutes daily) - feeding, environment maintenance
- Fish: Low (15-30 minutes daily) - feeding, periodic tank maintenance

### Cost Considerations (First Year)
- Dogs: $1,500-$2,500 (food, vet care, supplies, training)
- Cats: $800-$1,500 (food, vet care, litter, supplies)
- Small mammals: $300-$800 (cage, food, bedding, vet care)
- Birds: $400-$1,000 (cage, food, toys, vet care)
- Reptiles: $500-$1,200 (habitat setup, lighting, food, vet care)
- Fish: $200-$800 (tank, filter, heater, fish, food)

### Allergen Concerns
- Fur-bearing animals (cats, dogs, small mammals) may trigger allergies
- Reptiles and fish are typically better for allergy sufferers
- Birds produce dander that can cause allergic reactions
- Hypoallergenic dog breeds include Poodles, Bichon Frise, Schnauzers

### Noise Tolerance
- Dogs: Can be noisy (barking) - varies by breed and training
- Cats: Generally quiet (occasional meowing)
- Small mammals: Mostly quiet with some nocturnal activity
- Birds: Can be very vocal depending on species
- Reptiles: Silent
- Fish: Silent except for equipment noise

## Apartment-Friendly Pets
- Cats
- Small dog breeds (Bichon Frise, Shih Tzu, French Bulldog)
- Small mammals (hamsters, guinea pigs)
- Fish
- Certain reptiles (leopard geckos, small snake species)
- Some bird species (canaries, finches)

## Good Starter Pets
- Cats (adult cats require less training than kittens)
- Guinea pigs and rabbits (more handleable than smaller rodents)
- Leopard geckos and bearded dragons (easier reptiles)
- Betta fish and small community fish
- Smaller dog breeds with lower exercise needs

## Children-Compatible Pets
- Medium to large dogs with gentle temperaments
- Cats (though supervision needed with young children)
- Guinea pigs and rabbits (with parental supervision)
- Bearded dragons (for older children)
- Fish (for observing rather than handling)

## Working Professional Considerations
- Cats and pairs of small mammals adapt well to owner absences
- Adult dogs with lower exercise needs
- Reptiles with simple care routines
- Fish with automatic feeders
- Consider pet sitters or dog walkers for longer absences
